#   â–ˆ 		There are 2 parts to the project. First, Programming - The script let's the user see which   â–ˆ
#   â–ˆ programming languages (from python, rust, mysql, r and php) are installed on the system or install â–ˆ
#   â–ˆ one of them if not already installed. Also, the Projects option, creates folders for the user, and â–ˆ
#   â–ˆ lists project folders based on the programming language.                                           â–ˆ
#   â–ˆ                                                                                                    â–ˆ
#   â–ˆ 		Sencond, System - The script is able to list and create aliases for the user, update and     â–ˆ
#   â–ˆ upgrade, shows disk usage with sizes and usage percentages and show information about the running  â–ˆ
#   â–ˆ operating system, kernel version and more.                                                         â–ˆ

#   â–ˆ 		Additionally, the script has the option to count it's own number of code lines, for and      â–ˆ
#   â–ˆ while loops, if statements and printf's and echo usages.                                           â–ˆ
